### ShotHere - The answer to where ###

"This scene is amazing, I would love to see that place"

Ever thought about that when whatching a movie? Well I did :)!
I also wanted to gain experience in developing a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Rails") app with a strong front-end integration with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone.js"). So here is the result!

You can see it live hosted by the coool paas service -OpenShift- here : [http://shot-shothere.rhcloud.com/](http://shot-shothere.rhcloud.com/)

Thinking about helping this app grow?

Here's what you can do:

* Write an idea to integrate in the app [here](https://github.com/popox/ShotHere/issues)
* Code a new feature. Fork, Branch, Pull request..
* Promote the app to your friends. Talk about it, share it and use it!
* Eat an Oreo. Because that's always a good thing to do
* Buy me a beer. If ever you like the project
* Help someone in need. I'm sure you'll find someone to help
